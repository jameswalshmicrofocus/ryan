Description Gunnar Wagenknecht CLA Friend 2011-03-12 03:38:36 EST
Eclipse 3.7M6
EGit 0.11.3


I have on project in my workspace from an Eclipse Git mirror 
(cloned from git://dev.eclipse.org/org.eclipse.pde/build.git)

I only update the repo occasionally and today was one of those days. ;) I right clicked the repo and performed "Fetch" but then I realized that I wanted a "pull". Thus I right clicked again and selected "Pull". The fetch was still in progress but I think there are proper scheduling rules in place which prevent both operations from executing at the same time.

The pull operation failed with the message below. Even after a restart of Eclipse the pull operation still fails with the same exception.

Running git on the command line gave the following message:
---------------------------------------------------
fatal: Unable to create '.../.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
---------------------------------------------------


It seems that this is the case. After deleting the file manually I was able to successfully pull in EGit.

I think that EGit can do better. Instead of showing the error dialog the IOException could be a special lock failed/lock file exists exception which would bring up a dialog with a similar message and a "recover/try again" button  or so. EGit could also perform some checks/cleanups on the index (in case it really crashed).
